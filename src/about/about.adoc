=== Personal Interests
'''
I'm a proud geek and love watching SCI-FI (how great is The Expanse!), reading Fantasy novels and video gaming (I look forward to eventually getting my hands on a Steam Deck). When not doing any of those things you'll likely find me walking the dog along the beach or out for a skate on my electric skateboard.
